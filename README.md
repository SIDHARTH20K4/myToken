# myToken

It is a simple NFT minting project

Three important variables are created.
i. token name is created
ii. abbreviation of the token is created.
iii. a variable named totalsupply is initialised with 0 value. This value will be used the increment and decrement in future while minting and burning the NFT

then mapping function is used... it is basically compared the dictionaries in python
It creates a key value pair of address to and an unsigned integer

then comes the mint function. This function is the mint the NFT. When this function is used the value of the total supply and the vaule of the balances is increased.

and finally the burn function is to burn the NFTs. It simple decrements the value of the total suppy variablel and the balances value.
